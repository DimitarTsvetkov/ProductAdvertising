# ProductAdvertising
This is project for a responsive Landing Page for which I used responsive Web Design framework -Bootstrap.
The advertised product is chosen randomly. In order to provide a good User Experience (UX) I chose to use video presentation of the product like background and to point out the advantages of the product in 6 very simple buletpoints.
